Today, is my first day of setting up a Journal. Feels good to finally have a place to rant, and to log the shit i do.

Today, i completely refactored my Container Pipeline Service API code base, to make it a lot cleaner and lot more managable.

I did managed to expose a lot more of the data on via the API. Getting this done felt good, although my bigger achievement for today in this side is fully containerizing a openshift ready API Server for the pipeline.

Still waiting on openshift guys to help me figure out whats wrong with my PR's. They are not much by way of size, and infact, I am unable to make out why a couple of yaml files could cause such failures. I am no master of their test suite, though i hope to be one day, a master of openshift/kubernetes ;)

SSH'ed into some machines, with Dharmit to try and test changes to my registry garbage collection script. Expected to see a lot more images, but it was creepily empty, espcially considering the number of tests run on that setup. Need to get that sorted.

Cant figure out if a gun is reliable enough if there arent enough sample containers to shoot with it.

Managed to get the centos atomic base container on the Container Pipeline. I had a hand in building that minimilistic container, and its therefore, amazing to see your baby get out into the world like that.

Had christmas snacks today. It was decent, though of course the plum cake provided was, old, to put it mildly.

Also, guess we are going to go into a very long weekend for Christmas. Still havent figured out what my plans will be for the same.
