# Year 2018

## 2018 1 1, Monday

And so it begins, a new year. Again a very uneventful day. Watched a couple
of movies, continued some reading and played a couple of games. 

The pains that were the result of an aftermath from the treck have subsided.
Feeling pretty normal and comfortable now. I am hoping the new year brings
with it a lot more success and fun :)
