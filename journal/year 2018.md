Damn, forgot yesterday's entry. Gotta keep better track of this. Finally got
stuff packed. Still need to seal the box though.

Managed to get the weekly scan fix coded in and tested. Made sure to improve
the CentOS Devcloud setup script as well.

Added exception lists, and match lists to Pipeline garbage collector, while
refactoring it and making it more modular. Need to test that thing.

Had some interesting discussions, including convincing people to go for
gokarting. Should be a cool experience.

Guess i forgot to add the entry for today. I will still try to jog my memory
But dont expect too much.

We are fast approaching the day of the office move. I made sure to get the box,
started considering how i am going to pack stuff into it.

Figured out the issue with container pipeline weekly scans. Started coding the
fix. Also, got some discussion done with a friend about how he wants to
contribute to the Container Pipeline.

Wrote a script to automate settinng up of container pipeline on the CentOS
Devcloud, which is an openstack system.

And so it begins, a new year. Again a very uneventful day. Watched a couple
of movies, continued some reading and played a couple of games.

The pains that were the result of an aftermath from the treck have subsided.
Feeling pretty normal and comfortable now. I am hoping the new year brings
with it a lot more success and fun :)
