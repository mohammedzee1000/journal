# My Journal

This repository was created to hold my journal, where i will be logging all my experiences and my life. Before checking it out, please remember a few things.

1. Beware of ranting, as you might see me do it.
1. I am going to be very blunt here, so be ready for possible criticism, **you have been warned**.
1. It is awesome to be honest, and you are welcome to comment, but please do so, with honor :)

PS: Thanks to Jaseem Abid for inspiring me ;)

Note: This is not my personal dairy, so if something is too personal, you wont find it here. Come talk to me and let me decide, if you are worthy of knowing it.
